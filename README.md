# Tutoring-Services
A full stack web application designed using MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS & NodeJS
# Problem Statement
Traditional learning platforms are all very scattered and lack unity. They usually employ their own faculties and are locked under a subscription based service. This model web application aims to unify both tutors and students into a single platform and remains only as a free common platform where the tutor and the student can interact.
# Methodology
In order to achieve this, we are developing a web-based platform using the following frameworks.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database system.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js
- React: A JavaScript Library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment.
# Working
- Create all express routes we need for the API.
- Create a MongoDB Atlas database and connect
- to our web application using a package called
mongoose.
- Create a mongoose model for both courses and the users. User model hashes and validates email and password. Course model contains structure of the tutor data.
- Define the functions for the routes called
controllers.
- Create react application and set up all pages.
- Create react contexts to provide global states to full react application.
- Using JSON web tokens, create a secure login/signup functionality.
- For vit.com domain allow for tutor logins with only the account ownerâ€™s data and the ability to add and delete. For vitstudent.com domain allow for student logins with complete access to all tutor data with the ability to join.
